# Section 6: Object-Oriented Programming Part 1
## Classes, Constructors and Inheritance

- A **class** is like the blueprint for a house, we can use it as many times to build as many houses as we like
- An **object** is a new *instance* of the house that we use to build a *new* house with the *new* operator
- A **reference** is like the house address. There is only one address for every house, like there is one *reference* for every *object*.
You can write the address on another piece of paper (creating a new variable), but the address is still the same. We can
pass **references** as **parameters** to **constructors** and **methods**

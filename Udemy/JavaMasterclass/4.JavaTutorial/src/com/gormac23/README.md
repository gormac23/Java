# Section 4: Java Tutorial:
## Expressions, Statements, Code blocks, Methods and more
\
In this section, I moved more into coding with java by learning to use methods and code blocks inside if else statements.
Now that I am begining to code in Java, I was introduced to Coding Exercises which I put into its own seperate folder
in git.

Here, I was giving a specific problem and had to code and come up with a solution. The code is one class only,
but I ran my tests in the MainTest class instead. The code from the coding exercises is tested on Udemy but no definite
solution is giving which differs from the coding challenges.
